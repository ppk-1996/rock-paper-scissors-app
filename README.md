## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Regex
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS with syntax for types
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- Event listener can be be used with useEffect and useCallback in React to achieve smooth keyboard experience for the calculator.
- Tailwind can utilize CSS variables to create different themes easily
- direction rtl in CSS


### Continued development
All done I think XD
