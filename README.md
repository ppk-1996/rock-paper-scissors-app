## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS with syntax for types
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React Modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal) - React Modal

### What I learned

- mobile and desktop have different arrangment in html elements so I use different components for each screen.

### Continued development
- Bonus part
- Rules modal is not responsive if the screen size is changed while the modal is open.

### Useful resources

- Google
